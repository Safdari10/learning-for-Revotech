# What are Foundation Models?
# Foundation models are large-scale pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for different tasks like image recognition, text generation and multimodal Ai. 
# Multi-modal AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can process multiple types of data, such as images, speech, and text, in a single model.
# Foundation models are trained on large-scale datasets and can be fine-tuned for a variety of tasks.
# Examples of Foundation Models:
# 1. OpenAI's GPT-4 (Text generation, chatbots)
# 2. BLIP (Vision-language models like captioning, VQA)
# 3. CLIP (Image & text understanding)
# 4. DALL-E (AI-generated images)
# 5. Gemini AI (Google's multimodal model)
# 6. Flamingo (Facebook's multimodal model for vision and text generation)

# These models are pre-trained on massive datasets and can be adapted to different AI applications.


# How do Foundation Models work?
# 1. Pre-training: Them model is trained on huge datasets(text, images, audio etc). This step is computationally expensive and requires large amounts of data.
# 2. Fine-tuning: The model is adapted for specific tasks (e.g. medical AI, finance, robotics) using smaller datasets. This step is less computationally expensive.
# 3. Inference: The model is used to make predictions/ generate results based on new data/input. This step is fast and efficient.
# Example:
# GPT-4 writes essays, answers questions.
# BLIP generates image captions, answers visual questions.
# CLIP matches images with text descriptions.
